Once upon a time, in the bustling city of New York, there was a small pizzeria called "Mario's." It was owned by a friendly Italian man named Mario, who had learned the art of pizza-making from his nonna back in Naples.


Mario's pizzeria was known for its delicious, authentic Neapolitan pizzas, which were made with the freshest ingredients and baked to perfection in a wood-fired oven. The secret to the pizzeria's success was the care and attention that Mario put into every single pie. He used only the finest tomatoes, imported from the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, and the creamiest mozzarella, made from the milk of grass-fed cows in the Campania region.


It's not just about the pizzeria, but an environment made to build relationships, have fun and entertain.

For more than three decades, Marioâ€™s has been one of the most traditional pizzerias in the city of New York. Directed by Mario who fully dedicates his time to the development and improvement of culinary creations that have been consolidated with the approval of their customers.
